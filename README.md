Project descriptions:


1. Pneumonia detection classifier using x-ray images (Deep learning / AI)
Developed python based classifier for image detection using advanced CNNs (ResNets, VGGs) 
Chest x-ray image data cleaned and developed deep neural network models for classification 
Improved the models to obtain an accuracy around 95% 

2. Improving the accuracy of a P300 speller (Medical Device), Python 
ALS Patient EEG data was cleaned and preprocessed then Machine learning models were used : SVM, Logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis 
Obtained 100% accuracy using SVM 

3. Customer service management data analysis
Data model was designed using database relationships 
SQL querying was done for data analysis including advanced SQL queries using MySQL workbench

4. Improving Customer satisfaction using text classification (NLP, Python, Neural Networks)
Neural network model was developed for text classification
Obtained more than 90% accuracy with the testing data

7. Effects of Chemotherapy on cancer cells : simulation using advanced differential equations (Math modeling, Matlab)
Differential equations were solved manually and using Matlab and plotted to see the effects of the drugs.
Codes can be used to simulate different conditions using the models



9. Risk analysis using Medicare Claims data (python, machine learning, fraud detection)
Medicare part D data which includes prescriber and drugs were used in risk prediction
Risk of fraud was predicted using past fraud details by prescriber and department

10. Cervical spine fracture detection ( Deep learning, Computer vision) : Kaggle competition (On-going) 


11. Research projects (included in researchgate)
Model development researcher | Bcc and Fcc Ferromagnetic thin films development
Improved efficiency of spin coating to optimize the quality of products through simulations
Technologies and simulations used : Matlab, Python, Monte-Carlo simulation 
Worked on 2 research projects and published 2 papers
Analyzed and developed models to improve the properties of Bcc and Fcc thin films
Visualization to interpret changes to the new models and to check the productivity 
Collaborated with researchers to improve the quality of the products
Improved properties of thin films using modified math models (Matlab and python programming)

12. Covid-19 Mortality risk analysis (statistical modeling, R) : Analysis is done to See how the pre-existing conditions/ diseases affect Covid-19 death risk
Summary of descriptive statistics and t-test was done to see the p-values : this was done to check the significance of each factore/condition on risk
Uni and Multivariate Cox regression was performed to see the survival over time (strating from time of infecting) 
Finally, KM plot was created to see the survival probability over time comparing control to experimental individuals
