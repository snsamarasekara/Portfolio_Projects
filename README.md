# Portfolio_Projects
This repository consists of machine learning and deep learning models written in python and SQL projects.
In the first project, Machine Learning classifiers were used to improve the accuracy of a P300 speller and different filters and preprocessing methods were used.
Deep learning projects consist of different CNN architectures(ResNet, VGG) and used in detecting pneumonia from chest x-rays
